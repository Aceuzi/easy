Synopsis
--------

easy is a C++ library for manipulating exclusive-or sum-of-products (ESOP) forms.  An ESOP form is a two-level logic representation consisting of one level of AND-gates, followed by one level of XOR-gates.

The `easy` library provides data-structures and algorithms for ESOP synthesis and verification.
